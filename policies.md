## General

* Anyone is welcome
* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](/about.html#contact)!

## Mailing List

[hackerhours-list@meetup.com](mailto:hackerhours-list@meetup.com?subject=[JOB]) ([archive](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/messages/archive/))

General policies from above still apply.

* Messages can be coding/resource questions, or announcements *relevant to junior developers*.
* Meetup requires that you join [the respective meetup](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/) in order to send messages to the mailing list. Note that you need to send from the same email registered with that account.
* Any recruiting must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.
