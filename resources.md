## Troubleshooting

![calvin and hobbes](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1995/ch950617.gif)

Make sure to omit any passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.

* mailing lists or IRC channels for local user groups or projects
* [#hackerhours](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hackerhours) on Freenode (IRC)
* [Tutors](tutors.html)
* [Rubber Duck Problem Solving](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/rubber-duck-problem-solving.html)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (Q&A)
    * After posting a question to S.O., you are welcome to send the link to the mailing list (hackerhours-list@meetup.com) with a brief description.  That way, you can potentially get an answer sooner (and from more people) than contacting a mentor directly, and the discussion/solution benefits others.
