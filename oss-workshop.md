title: Open Source Workshop
---

{% include oss_workshop/event.html %}

Did you know you can make meaningful contributions to the code powering thousands of websites, and running in millions of browsers? You can improve your coding, technical writing and collaboration skills, expand your professional network, and help advance the art of software engineering all in one fun way: contribute to open source! It looks good on your resume, teaches you how to be thorough and work within teams, and gives you inside access to some of the coolest projects being built.

## Format

This is a workshop for people who have never contributed to open source – we will try to have activities for every skill level / skillset. We’re still working out details around what project(s) we’ll be working on (and would love suggestions!), but it will be some combination of:

* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials/guides
* Collecting resources
* Adding features
* Adding tests
* Fixing bugs
* Helping other people do all of these things

In order to have everyone with a baseline level of setup/knowledge, we ask that you get set up with GitHub and learn how to submit a pull request in order to RSVP. Please follow the steps below to do so.

**Interested in having people contribute to your open source project? Would you like to mentor? Want to ask a question? Have a suggestion for how we could make this workshop better? [Drop us a line](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/issues/new), and/or check out [our planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyYIkeZ_htZ76tmrA06UakSvkOX7ghWL4RG7Gr6oIbE/edit).**

## Schedule

Please arrive on time!

* **12:15-12:30** – welcome
* **12:30-12:45** – dividing into teams

## How to RSVP

<!-- ripping off of http://18f.github.io/hourofcode/ -->

Note that we have a limited number of spots, so do this sooner than later! Should take less than ten minutes.

1. If you don't have one already, start by [creating a Github account](https://github.com).
1. Open up [the participant data files](https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/tree/gh-pages/_data/oss_workshop/participants) in a new tab.
1. Click on the blue `+` sign next to the header `hackerhours.org/_data/oss_workshop/participants/`.
1. In the "Name your file..." box, type in your GitHub username (which is displayed in the top right of your screen) followed by `.yml`. For example: `janesmith1.yml`
1. Copy the text below into the editor (it's [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Examples) format, if you were wondering), and replace  your own info.
    * Example:

          name: Cookie Monster
          emoji: 'cookie'
          description: I bring a hunger for open source...cookies. Also learning Angular.

    * `emoji`: Pick your favorite icon [from this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/), but surround with quotes rather than colons.
    * `description`: Tell us what you bring to this event. Skills, interest, willingness to mentor, etc.
1. Click the green "Propose new file" button.
1. Click the green "Create pull request" button.

**You will get an email when we've confirmed your RSVP. We will send any announcements to the Hacker Hours mailing list**, so make sure you are part of [the meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/). If you want to get a head start with building up your open source skills, check out [the Resources page](/resources.html#getting-involved-in-open-source).
